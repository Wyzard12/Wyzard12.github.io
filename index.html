Instead of creating a new environment, I deliberately reused the original level and enemy setups to focus entirely on improving gameplay systems and player feedback.The core mechanics from Canberra were significantly refined to create a more responsive and dynamic experience. One of the key additions was the implementation of <i>ragdoll physics</i>, which enhanced the sense of impact and physicality during combat. Alongside this, new <i>animations</i> and enhanced mision system were introduced to improve visual clarity, movement fluidity, and overall game feel."

The 3D models were sourced from <b>Synty</b>, and the animations were created using <b>Mixamo</b>. Due to my limited experience in animation, the development process came with its fair share of challenges.

                <br><br>A standout feature of Porto 1 is its <b>mobile layout</b>, recognizing that most people access websites on their phones rather than laptops or desktops. I dedicated time to developing a mobile-friendly layout. Additionally, to reach a wider audience, I created a popup menu that links to <i>Dutch</i> and <i>Vietnamese</i> versions of the homepage. Since not everyone is fluent in English, I wanted to ensure that language barriers wouldn’t disrupt the user experience, so I added these two languages for accessibility."

                 data-additional-text="<b>Project QUBE (codename: Kuijpers)</b> is an <i>AR initiative</i> designed to help SiNTLUCAS students understand volume and perimeter concepts in math. Created on April 17, 2024, the project has not been fully launched, but it was successfully showcased at the <b>Fontys XR</b> event on June 21, 2024, despite being unfinished. As the first student to lay the groundwork for this project, I placed the initial stepping stone, and future students will continue to work on and improve it.
                                Once completed, the project will be implemented as part of the school's program to aid students in mastering math concepts using AR, projecting cubes and 3D shapes into physical spaces for interactive learning. The Fontys XR event is organized by Fontys Eindhoven and aims to bring together students from different schools to conduct workshops on their XR/AR-related projects. These projects may range from games designed for people with disabilities, health improvement through gamified exercises, or training-focused applications. The event not only helps students refine their projects with feedback from teachers and peers but also allows educators to gain new insights into virtual reality and explore how it can be integrated into training programs.">

                 data-description="<b>Codename: Space</b> was the first project I worked on with two classmates, where we collaborated to develop a game. We called ourselves <b>2DudesStudio</b>, driven by the dream of creating an indie studio with promising projects and games. During this time, we created a rough draft and an alpha tech demo titled <b>Codename Space</b> for the <i>Shine!</i> event, showcasing it to parents, teachers, and fellow students.
                <br><br>
                Although Space had a lot of potential, the project only reached the alpha tech demo stage, and the ideas remained in draft form. Unfortunately, 2DudesStudio disbanded shortly after due to creative differences and delays in character design. Despite the dissolution, I gained valuable lessons that shaped my journey in game development.

                 data-description="Rigidbody was my first major project during my first year of game development. It was part of a special program at SiNTLUCAS, where I had the chance to develop projects of my choice to demonstrate my passion and ability to continue in Game Development. For this project, I chose to create a spin-off of <i>Flappy</i> Bird with different modes. Initially, I followed a tutorial video, but I later designed various levels, including co-op mode, increased gravity, and obstacles like flying knives.

                 data-description="<b>Cartographer: Project Seventeen</b> was my first project outside of game development. I studied photography for three months as my elective course, simply because photography has always been a passion of mine. At one point, I had debated between pursuing game development or photography in my studies; in the end, I chose game development, but the allure of photography continued to draw me in, and I wanted to experience the world through the lens at least once.
                <br><br>
                During my three-month photography course, I received an assignment that remains a personal favorite: to create a photo series about seventeen-year-olds, capturing their style, lifestyle, and unique stories in a printed album. This project is particularly meaningful to me, as it gave me a fresh perspective and creative freedom beyond what I experienced in game development. I didn't worry about finding models since I knew several classmates from my first year who were open to participating. All I needed was to borrow a camera and start shooting."

                 data-additional-text="After selecting my best shots, I began designing the album, which turned out to be my busiest and most challenging period. The project required me to use <i>Adobe InDesign</i>, a program I had never worked with before. With guidance from my teachers, I gradually developed a unique style for my book. The story I wanted to tell focused on the thoughts, emotions, love, and growth of young people at seventeen (interestingly, none of the people featured were exactly seventeen; they were either older or younger).
                <br><br>
                As the project progressed, I decided to challenge myself further by creating and editing a teaser video. Video editing had been something I enjoyed, especially after using Premiere Pro in a first-year project, and I wanted to dive back into it. Eventually, after much effort, <i>Cartographer</i> was completed.
